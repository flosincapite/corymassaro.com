<p>My name is Cory Massaro. I write speculative fiction in both prose and verse. I grew up in Ohio, U.S.A., in a working-class Rust Belt town; I am currently at home in Quito, Ecuador. I hold a B.A. in creative writing and classics from Duke University as well as M.A.s in comparative literature and computational linguistics. I love to learn new languages and find ways to speak them!</p>

<p>I am <i><a href="https://thewildword.com">The Wild Word</a></i>'s associate editor and fiction editor. Since October 2021, I've been producing a column there called <i><a href="https://thewildword.com/lets-do-luddism/">Let's Do Luddism</a></i>, as well as an ongoing flash fiction/poetry series, <i>The Luddite Bestiary</i>. The former is broadly techno-pessimistic; the latter treats technology through imaginative genres like speculative evolution.</p>

<p>I write because I have some Thoughts and I hope somebody will correct them. For example, I don't believe in technology, but I do think that one day a bird or plant will accidentally do something cool with technological trash. I don't believe in Amerigo; I do believe in <i>Abya Yala</i> and Turtle Island. I have experienced mental illness and seen it unfold around me; I believe it is both a health crisis and also a political crisis caused by poverty and working class torment.</p>

<p>I have all of these Thoughts on labor and mental health and technology because, for the last several years, writing software has been my Neoliberalism Survival Tactic. I have primarily worked in language technology and related fields. On the lighter side, this has added a new dimension to my writing practices. I give multi-lingual writing workshops where participants use software tools to find inspiration in the infinite linguistic landfill of the Internet. Check out my <a href="/workshops/">workshops</a> and <a href="/experimental-art">experimental art</a> pages for more information.</p>

<p>If you also have Bad Thoughts about technology and labor politics; or if you want to weld poems from stuff you find in the Junkyard Internet; or if you want to read about speculative avian evolution, I hope you'll find something here to interest you.</p>
