<p>Hi, I'm Cory. I write speculative fiction, usually in prose, sometimes in verse. I also translate speculative writing into English. I grew up in working-class exurbs of Ohio, u.s.a., and am currently at home in Quito, Ecuador. I hold a B.A. in creative writing and classics from Duke University, as well as M.A.s in comparative literature and computational linguistics. I love to learn new languages and go on adventures where I get to speak them.</p>

<p>I am <i>The Wild Word</i>'s associate editor and fiction editor. Since October 2021, I've been producing a column there called <i>Let's Do Luddism</i>, as well as an ongoing flash fiction/poetry series, <i>The Luddite Bestiary</i>. The former is broadly techno-pessimistic; the latter treats technology through imaginative genres like speculative evolution.</p>

<p>I write because I have some Thoughts, and I think they're well-founded, and I hope somebody will correct me. For example, I don't believe in technology, but I do think that one day a bird or plant will accidentally do something cool with technological trash. I don't believe in Amerigo; I do believe in <i>Abya Yala</i> and Turtle Island. I think mental illness is a health crisis and also a political crisis caused by poverty and working class torment; I think both of these things because I've seen it work both ways. You can find more on these topics on my why I write page.</p>

<p>I have all of these Thoughts on labor and mental health and technology because, for the last several years, writing software has been my Neoliberalism Survival Tactic. I have primarily worked in language technology and related fields. On the lighter side, this has added a new dimension to my writing practices. I give multi-lingual writing workshops where participants use software tools to find inspiration in the infinite linguistic landfill of the Internet. Check out my <a href="/workshops">workshops</a> page for more information.</p>

<p>If you also have Bad Thoughts about technology and labor politics; or if you want to weld poems from stuff you find in the Junkyard Internet; or if you want to read about speculative avian evolution, you might find something here to pique your interest. Welcome to my website.</p>
